Project Workflow~

1.	Data Preprocessing:
_______________________
   
  o	Handled missing values through appropriate imputation techniques.
  
  o	Transformed categorical variables using Label Encoder.
  
  o	Scaled numerical features for better model performance.
  
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis:
_______________________________
   
  o	Visualized the relationships between features and the loan status.
  
  o	Analyzed distribution patterns of key attributes like income, loan amount, and credit history.
  
3.	Model Building:
________________________
   
  o	Implemented various machine learning algorithms including:
  
  •		Logistic Regression

  •		Random Forest

  •		Support Vector Machine (SVM)

  •		KNeighborsClassifier

  o	Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
  
4.	Model Evaluation:
_________________________
   
  o	Evaluated models using accuracy_score
  
5.	Final Model:
_________________________
    
  o	Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
  
  o	Provided insights on feature importance to understand the key factors influencing loan approval.

Results~
   
  •	The final model achieved an accuracy of 78%
  
  •	The most influential features in predicting loan status included credit history, applicant’s income, and loan amount.
